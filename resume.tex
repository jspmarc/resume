\section{Introduction}

I'm Josep Marcello, an avid software engineer from Indonesia. I have a keen interest in distributed
and parallel systems which leads to me loving building scalable software and systems. Even though I
my main interest is parallel and distributed systems, I have a large experience in web development,
especially in back-end which is used by both web applications and mobile applications. I also have
a deep attention to detail to keep code clean and be as resource optimized as possible.
